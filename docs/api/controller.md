# Controller

## Controller builder

Computation expression used to create Saturn controllers - abstraction representing REST-ish enpoint for serving HTML views or returning data. It supports:
* set of predefined actions that are automatically mapped to the enpoints following standard conventions
* embedding sub-controllers for modeling one-to-many relationships 
* versioning 
* adding plugs for particular action which in principle provides same mechanism as attributes in ASP.NET MVC applications. 
* defining common error handler for all actions
* defining not-found action

Result of the computation expression is standard Giraffe's `HttpHandler`which means that it's easily composable with other parts of the ecosytem.

It doesn't provide SQL generation, or an out-of-the-box command-line tool, or other fancy features. It does however provide a set of simple, extendable, and composable tools for integrating migrations into your application.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBuilt on top of the battle-tested ASP.NET Core foundation, a highly flexible, extendable model of Giraffe Saturn provides high level abstractions, helpers and tools to enable high developer productivity, at the same time keeping high application performance provided by Kestrel and Giraffe.\n\n\nSaturn is made up of a number of distinct parts, each with its own purpose and role to play in building a web application.\n\n\n\n\nApplication\n\n\nthe start and end of the request lifecycle\n\n\nhandles all aspects of requests up until the point where the router takes over\n\n\nprovides a core set of plugs to apply to all requests\n\n\ndispatches requests into a router\n\n\nenables application and hosting configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouter\n\n\nparses incoming requests and dispatches them to the correct controller/action, passing parameters as needed\n\n\nprovides helpers to generate route paths or urls to resources\n\n\ndefines named pipelines through which we may pass our requests\n\n\nallow easy application of groups of plugs to a set of routes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControllers\n\n\nprovide functions, called \nactions\n, to handle requests\n\n\nactions:\n\n\nprepare data and pass it into views\n\n\ninvoke rendering via views\n\n\nperform redirects\n\n\nreturns data as JSON or XML\n\n\nand much more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews\n\n\nrender templates\n\n\nact as a presentation layer\n\n\ndefine helper functions, available in templates, to decorate data for presentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChannels  \n[Not implemented yet]\n\n\nmanage sockets for easy realtime communication\n\n\nare analogous to controllers except that they allow bi-directional communication with persistent connections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaffolding scripts\n\n\ndotnet new\n template providing good starting point for new applications - \nhttps://github.com/SaturnFramework/Saturn.Template\n\n\ndotnet saturn\n CLI tool that controls migrations and let you easily scaffold new parts of application - \nhttps://github.com/SaturnFramework/Saturn.Dotnet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to contribute\n\n\nImposter syndrome disclaimer\n: I want your help.
